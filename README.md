These are multiple projects from my two CS classes in my senior year of high school

# Advanced Programming Topics
Advanced Programming Topics was a Java class covering Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as threads, and GUI.

## Python Game:
I coded a basic Snake game with a partner using threads, Java GUI, and object-oriented programming.

# Intermediate Data Programming
Intermediate Data Programming was offered for college credit through the University of Washinton (CSE 163). This class focused on Python and data processing (pandas, numpy, scikitlearn).

## idp final project:
A partnered research project analyzing pregnancy in the USA. Uploaded to this Github is part of the plot visualization code. We utilized plotly, pandas, geopandas, and matplotlib on many datasets to create a wide range of data visualiations and answer research questions about pregnancy in the U.S. We also conducted a lot of data cleaning and reshaping in order to sort through, combine, and optimally reshape datasets.

## search engine:
A python program using term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency to create a search engine for a corpus of documents. Built using test-driven development, and also involved extensive testing.
