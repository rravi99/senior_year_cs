These are multiple projects from my two CS classes in my senior year of high school

The first class was Advanced Programming Topics, which was a Java class covering Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as threads, and GUI.

Python Game:
I coded a basic Snake game with a partner using threads, Java GUI, and object-oriented programming.

The second class was Intermediate Data Programming, which was offered for college credit through the University of Washinton (CSE 163). This class focused on Python and data processing (pandas, numpy, scikitlearn).

#idp final project:
A partnered research project analyzing pregnancy in the USA. Utilized plotly, pandas, geopandas, and matplotlib on many datasets to create a wide range of data visualiations and answer research questions about pregnancy in the U.S.

search engine:
A python program using term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency to create a search engine for a corpus of documents. Built using test-driven development, and also involved extensive testing.
